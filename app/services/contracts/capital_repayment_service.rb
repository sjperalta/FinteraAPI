module Contracts
  # Service for handling capital repayment on contracts
  # When a user makes a capital repayment, we:
  # 1. Apply the prepayment to reduce the contract balance
  # 2. Then calculate the remaining amount, this serve to identify how many payments to reajust
  # 3. Identify the last pending payments that cover that remaining amount
  # 4. Mark those payments as "reajustment" since they will be recalculated
